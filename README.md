This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player gets three in a row or all spaces are filled.
The game also includes a reset button to start a new game. 
This game has got some simple yet cool animations in css, with some pop ups for unvisited cell and colour determination for signalling the turn of player 'X' or 'O'.
Enjoy playing!
